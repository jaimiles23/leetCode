# Introduction
A tree is a frequently used data structure to simulate a hierarchical tree structure.

Each node of the tree has a root reference and a list of references to other nodes, called _child nodes_. A tree can be defined as an acyclic (not a cycle), directed graph that has N nodes and N-1 edges.

A _Binary Tree_ is one of the most typical data structures - a tree data structure that has at most two children, aka left and right childs. 

This section covers:
- the concept of a tree and a binay tree.
- different transveral methods
- using recursion to solve binary-tree related problems.
