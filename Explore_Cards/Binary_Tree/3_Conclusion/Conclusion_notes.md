# Binary Tree Explore Card
leetCode gives a good introduction to binary trees. I feel infinitely more confident now working with binary tree data structures than I did before starting the card. 

I acknowledge that effective solutions to the exercises presented in the conclusion section are beyond my current ability. I could slowly and inefficiently work through the solutions and most likely derive non-optimized solutions to the problems. This is not in my current interest - I adventured into this Explore Card to get a taste of Binary Tree structures; I did not enter the card with the intention of spending the better part of a week and a half struggling through the card. 

I would like to come back and complete these conclusion exercises - undoubtedly after I have studied more binay trees more as a data structure and developed a deeper appreciation and understanding of them. I'm glad with the progress that I've made so far, and I find it sufficient for my purposes.
