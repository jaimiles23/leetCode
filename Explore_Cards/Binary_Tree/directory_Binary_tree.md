# Overview
This is a formal training on tree data structures. I have worked with binary trees in problem sets before, but without confidence. My aim in achieving this card is to be confident working with binary tree data structures and solidify other skills I have already developed, e.g., using recursion to navigate a binary tree.

# Card structure

## 1. Overview

## 2. Transverse a Tree

## 3. Solve a problem recursively

## 4. Conclusion
