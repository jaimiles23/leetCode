# Overview
This file contains notes and exercises from leetCode's Introduction to Algorithms [Recursion 1](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/)

**Motivation**
I have already explored recursion in several leetCode challenges and online videos. This course is meant to further my understanding of the basics.

# Introduction
In this Explore card, we answer the following questions:

1. What is recursion? How does it work?
2. How to solve a problem recursively?
3. How to analyze the time and space complexity of a recursive algorithm?
4. How can we apply recursion in a better way?

## Principles of Recursion
- *Principle_of_recursion.md* has initial notes on recursion
- *Reverse_string.py* tests userdefined recursion function to print word(s) backwards.
- *Recursion_function.md* provides guidelines to implement a recursive function
- *Swap_nodes_in_pairs.py* - changes order of every adjacent pair of list nodes.

## Recurrence Relation
- *Recurrence_relation.md* discusses the relationship between a problem and its subproblems and how to derive a mathematical formula
- *Pascals_triangle.py* implements a Pascal's triangle with a variety of solutions
