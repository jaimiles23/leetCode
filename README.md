need to update readme with more thorough description of leetcode problems. Also note that this will contain learning exercises too.

# leetCode Problems
This repository contains my write-ups for different challenges from [leetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/).

## Getting Started
leetCode problems are readily accessible on the browser. The name of each folder corresponds to the problem listed on leetCode. Solutions to each problem may be pasted directly into the browser console and submitted.

## Navigating
Directories may include 

Each directory represents a leetcode problem.  In each folder, you may find:
* _Directions_: explains the premise of the problem with a link to the URL.
* _Directory_: documents the different files in the folder.
* _Solutions_: any number of solutions I submitted. All solutions will start with the prefix "sol_"
* _Auxillary files_: may entail speed test comparisons of solutions and log files. All auxillary files start with the prefix "x_"

## Languages:
1. **Python** is the first language I learned. Thus far, all solutions have been submitted in Python as I practice other programming concepts.
