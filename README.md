Note: also indicate that this is a platform for code self review. Once I start review PEP8, come back and re-write code. Also check for long-term readability, etc.

# leetCode Problems
This repository contains my write-ups for different challenges and learning materials from [leetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/).

leetCode is an online resource to learn programming in an applied environment. Users write solutions to programming problems and compete with other users to minimize runtime speed and memory consumption. Problems require knowledge of programming concepts, mathematics, and logic. These problems are often used in interviews to assess applicant's proficiency in programming.

## Getting Started
leetCode problems are readily accessible in the browser. Each problem is defined by a number and a title, e.g., _#720 Longest Word in Dictionay_. Problems include a description and examples. User solutions runs through various test cases to score for accuracy, speed, and memory consumption. 

There are 3 difficulties of problems: easy, medium, and hard.

## Navigating
This repository primarily contains solutions to leetCode challenges, as well as notes from leetCode learning resources. 
- Challenge solutions are listed in directories starting with numbers, e.g., "720_". 
- Learning resources notes are listed in directories with the prefix "lr_".

### Problem solutions
In each solution directory, the following files may be available:
* _Directions_: provides the description taken directly from leetCode with a link to the URL.
* _Directory_: explains the different files in the folder.
* _Solutions_: any number of solutions I submitted. All solutions will start with the prefix "sol_"
* _Auxillary files_: may entail speed test comparisons of solutions and log files. All auxillary files start with the prefix "x_"

#### Directions

#### Directory
Note: 

#### Solutions
Please note: each solution uses the class 'Solution'. This naming convention is preserved from leetcode and used so that the solutions can be pasted directly into the console.

### Learning resources
The learning resources are those available on leetCode. These include notes and exercises from each section.

## Languages:
1. **Python** is the first language I learned. Thus far, all solutions have been submitted in Python as I practice other programming concepts.
