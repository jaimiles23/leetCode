# leetCode Problems
This repository contains my write-ups for different challenges from [leetCode.com](https://leetcode.com/problems/self-dividing-numbers/).

## Getting Started
leetCode problems are readily accessible on anyone's computer.  These solutions can be submitted directly into the console for each problem.

## Navigating
Each directory represents a leetcode problem.  In each folder, you may find:
* _Directions_: explains the premise of the problem with a link to the URL.
* _Directory_: documents the different files in the folder.
* _Solutions_: any number of solutions I submitted. All solutions will start with the prefix "sol_"
* _Auxillary files_: may entail speed test comparisons of solutions and log files. All auxillary files start with the prefix "x_"

## Languages:
1. **Python** Python is the first language I learned. I did all of my initial projects in Python as I learned other programming concepts.
